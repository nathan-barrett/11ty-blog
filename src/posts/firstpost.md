## Hi, its me

Hello - and welcome to my new blog! I've created this page with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), which is a very simple static site generator. Recently I've become tired of needing the JS bloat that comes with frameworks, and opted to use 11ty as a simplier solution.

I'd like to use this blog as a way to share a bit of my journey through tech, as well as whatever other random things end up on here.

I started working in the tech industry in 2018, but previously worked in a variety of places: coffee shops, bakeries, customer service and non-profit community organizing. I now work at Mozilla as a Web Developer in Marketing - working on website projects and other things that I can get involved with. Some of my favorite work has been in these projects:

- [Protocol](https://protocol.mozilla.org) - mozilla.org's design system
- [True Colors](https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113708/https://truecolors.firefox.com/) - page made in partnership with Disney/Pixar for the release of their movie, Turning Red
- [Mozilla Stories Blog](https://mozilla.org/stories) - Blog focused on the products and people at mozilla

I hope that this blog is something that I can dedicate some time to, both to record what I've been working on but also for some rants on the New York Mets.
